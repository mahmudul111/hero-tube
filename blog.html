        <p>
            var, let, and const are
            three different ways to
            declare variables in
            JavaScript, and they have
            different scopes and
            behaviors. Understanding
            their scopes is crucial for
            writing clean and
            predictable code.
            <br>

            <span
                class="text-3xl font-semibold">var:</span>
            <br>
            Function-Scoped: Variables
            declared with var are
            function-scoped, which means
            they are accessible only
            within the function in which
            they are declared. If
            declared outside any
            function, they become
            globally scoped.
            Hoisting: Declarations with
            var are hoisted, which means
            the variable is moved to the
            top of its containing
            function or global scope
            during compilation. However,
            only the declaration is
            hoisted, not the
            initialization.
            Can be redeclared within the
            same scope.
        </p>
        <span
            class="text-3xl font-semibold">let:</span>
        <br>

        Block-Scoped: Variables declared
        with let are block-scoped,
        meaning they are accessible only
        within the block (enclosed by
        curly braces) in which they are
        defined. They are also
        function-scoped when declared
        within a function.
        Not hoisted: Like var, let
        declarations are hoisted, but
        unlike var, they are not
        initialized with undefined by
        default.
        Cannot be redeclared within the
        same scope.
        </p>
        <span
            class="text-3xl font-semibold">const:</span>
        <br>

        Block-Scoped: Like let,
        variables declared with const
        are block-scoped.
        Not hoisted: Similar to let,
        const declarations are also
        hoisted but not initialized with
        undefined.
        Constants: Variables declared
        with const cannot be reassigned
        after initialization. However,
        if the variable is an object or
        an array, its properties or
        elements can be modified.

            Tell us the use cases of
            <span
                class=" bg-slate-400 rounded-lg py-1 px-4">null</span>,
            and <span
                class="bg-slate-400 rounded-lg py-1 px-4">undefined</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, null and
            undefined are two distinct
            values that are often used
            to represent missing or
            non-existent data. They have
            specific use cases and
            meanings within the
            language:
            <br>
            <span
                class="text-3xl font-semibold">null:</span>
            <br>

            Explicit Absence of Value:
            null is a value that
            represents the explicit
            absence of any object value
            or no value at all. It is
            often used when you want to
            indicate that a variable
            should have no meaningful
            value or that an object
            property or array element is
            intentionally empty.
            Assigned by Developers:
            Developers typically set a
            variable to null to indicate
            that it has no value or that
            it should be cleared of any
            existing value.
            Use Cases:
            Initializing variables that
            will hold objects later.
            Clearing values from
            variables.
            Marking an element in an
            array or property in an
            object as intentionally
            empty.
            <br>
            <span
                class="text-3xl font-semibold">undefined:</span>
            <br>

            Implicit Absence of Value:
            undefined is a value that
            indicates a variable has
            been declared but has not
            been assigned a value yet.
            It is also returned when you
            try to access an object
            property or array element
            that does not exist.
            Automatically Assigned:
            JavaScript automatically
            assigns undefined to
            variables that are declared
            but not explicitly
            initialized.
            Use Cases:
            Default values for function
            parameters when no argument
            is passed.
            As the initial value of
            variables before they are
            assigned a meaningful value.
            To check if a property or
            variable exists.

            What do you mean by REST
            API? </h3>
        <p>
            REST API, or
            Representational State
            Transfer Application
            Programming Interface, is a
            set of architectural
            principles and constraints
            for designing and
            interacting with web
            services. It is an approach
            to building networked
            applications and services in
            a way that leverages the
            HTTP protocol and its
            features. REST is commonly
            used for creating APIs in
            web and mobile applications
            because of its simplicity,
            scalability, and ease of
            use.

            Key characteristics and
            principles of REST APIs
            <br>
            include:
            <br>

            Stateless: Each request from
            a client to a server must
            contain all the information
            needed to understand and
            process the request. The
            server does not store any
            client state. This makes
            REST APIs scalable and easy
            to manage.

            Resource-Based: In REST,
            everything is treated as a
            resource, which can be a
            physical object, a data
            entity, or a concept.
            Resources are uniquely
            identified by URIs (Uniform
            Resource Identifiers).

            HTTP Methods: REST APIs use
            standard HTTP methods (GET,
            POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to
            perform actions on
            resources. Each method has a
            specific meaning and should
            correspond to a specific
            CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
            Delete) operation.
            <br>

            Stateless Communication:
            <br>
            Communication between
            clients and servers in REST
            is stateless, meaning each
            request/response pair is
            independent and does not
            rely on previous requests or
            responses.

            Representation: Resources
            can have multiple
            representations (e.g., JSON,
            XML, HTML) to support
            different clients or use
            cases. Clients specify their
            desired representation using
            HTTP headers.

            Uniform Interface: REST APIs
            follow a uniform and
            consistent set of
            constraints, including the
            use of standard HTTP
            methods, resource URIs, and
            self-descriptive messages.

            Layered System: A REST
            architecture can be
            organized into multiple
            layers, such as load
            balancers, caching, and
            authentication, which can
            improve scalability and
            security.

            Stateless Server: Servers in
            a RESTful architecture do
            not store any client state
            between requests, which
            allows for easy horizontal
            scaling.

            Cacheability: Responses from
            the server can be explicitly
            marked as cacheable or
            non-cacheable using HTTP
            caching mechanisms,
            improving performance and
            reducing server load.

            Client-Server Separation:
            The client and server are
            separate entities that
            communicate over a network.
            This separation allows for
            independent development and
            scalability of both clients
            and servers.

            Self-Descriptive Messages:
            REST APIs should include
            metadata or information
            about how to interpret the
            data, making the API more
            self-explanatory and easier
            to use.

            Overall, RESTful APIs are
            widely used in web
            development for building web
            services that can be
            consumed by a variety of
            clients, including web
            browsers, mobile apps, and
            other server-side
            applications. They provide a
            flexible and scalable way to
            expose and interact with
            data and services over the
            internet.
